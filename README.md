Simple Git Workflow Tutorial - Hello World Python Project
This tutorial walks you through the complete workflow using a very simple Python project. You'll create a few Python files, make commits, and practice basic Git operations.
How This Tutorial Works
This tutorial uses a hybrid approach that combines the best of both worlds:
PyCharm IDE for Python Development

Writing code: Use PyCharm's powerful editor with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error detection
Testing programs: Run your Python files directly in PyCharm using the green play button or Shift+F10
File management: Create new Python files through PyCharm's interface
Debugging: Use PyCharm's built-in debugger when needed

Git Bash for Version Control

All Git commands: Use Git Bash (command line) for git add, git commit, git push, etc.
Repository management: Clone, branch, and merge operations through the terminal
File system navigation: Use cd, ls, and other command-line tools

Why This Approach?

Learning fundamentals: Understanding Git commands helps you work in any environment
Universal skills: Command-line Git works everywhere (VS Code, Sublime, Vim, etc.)
Problem-solving: When PyCharm's Git integration has issues, you'll know how to fix them
Professional workflow: Many teams use command-line Git even with IDEs
